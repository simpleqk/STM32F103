The FreeRTOS download includes five sample memory allocation implementations, each of which are described in the following subsections. 
Following below:

    heap_1 - the very simplest, does not permit memory to be freed.
    heap_2 - permits memory to be freed, but does not coalescence adjacent free blocks.
    heap_3 - simply wraps the standard malloc() and free() for thread safety.
    heap_4 - coalescences adjacent free blocks to avoid fragmentation. Includes absolute address placement option.
    heap_5 - as per heap_4, with the ability to span the heap across multiple non-adjacent memory areas.
